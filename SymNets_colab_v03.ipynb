Then the first thing you will do is train your model on $P_{train}$. Since this is your <i>source domain </i>, you are allowed to use label information (e.g. use a cross entropy loss in your training step). In your test step, you are going to evaluate the model on $RW_{test}$. This will achieve a certain accuracy; since we only trained on the source domain, and not on the target domain, this accuracy refers to the source only scenario. We call it $acc_{so}$. Now you want to evaluate your UDA component which, differently from the former case, implies training on the target domain. Since you are not allowed to use labels there, here you will use any UDA device of your choice. So, in this case, in your training step, you will train supervisedly on $P_{train}$ (like you did before) and simultaneously train unsupervisedly on $RW_train$. In your test step, once again, you want to evaluate on $RW_{test}$. This will achieve a new accuracy $acc_{uda}$, which hopefully will be higher than $acc_{so}$ since this time you also trained on the target domain, even if without label information. At this point you can compute your gain G:\n","$$G = acc_{uda} − acc_{so}$$"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"s7bKkf9g0G9u"},"outputs":[],"source":["class SourceModelTrainer:\n","    _INF = 1e20 \n","    \n","    def __init__(self, model: FeatureExtractor, n_classes: int, epochs: int):\n","        \"\"\"Initialize the SymsNet model\n","        Args:\n","            model (FeatureExtractor): _description_\n","            n_classes (int): _description_\n","            epochs (int): _description_\n","        \"\"\"\n","        self.patience = 10 \n","        self.curr_epoch = 0\n","        self.tot_epochs = epochs\n","        self.n_classes = n_classes\n","        self.model = model \n","        if cuda.is_available():\n","            self.model = self.model.cuda()\n","        # Cross entropy Loss\n","        self.loss = CrossEntropyLoss()\n","            \n","    def train_step(self, X_source: Tensor, y_source: Tensor):\n","        # Tell model go training mode\n","        self.model.model.train()\n","        # Compute features for both inputs\n","        X_source_features = self.model.model(X_source)\n","        # Compute overall training objective losses\n","        general_loss = self.loss(X_source_features, y_source)\n","        # Compute gradients w.r.t. classifier loss\n","        self.model.optim.zero_grad()\n","        general_loss.backward()\n","        # Perform optimizer step    \n","        self.model.optim.step()\n","        target = y_source.clone().tolist()\n","        preds = X_source_features.clone()\n","        return general_loss, accuracy_score(target, torch.argmax(preds, dim=1))\n","        \n","    \n","    def train_epoch(self, source_dataloader: DataLoader):\n","        end_of_epoch = False\n","        source_batch_loader = enumerate(source_dataloader)\n","        gen_loss = []\n","        acc = []\n","        # Train for current epoch\n","        while not end_of_epoch:\n","            try:\n","                # Get next batch for both source and target\n","                (X_source, y_source) = source_batch_loader.__next__()[1]\n","                loss, accuracy = self.train_step(X_source, y_source)\n","                gen_loss.append(loss.item())\n","                acc.append(accuracy)\n","            except StopIteration: \n","                end_of_epoch = True\n","        return mean(gen_loss), mean(acc)\n","            \n","    def train(self, source_dataloader: DataLoader):\n","        prev_general_loss = self._INF\n","        prev_acc_source = 0.0\n","        patience = self.patience \n","        epoch_iter = tqdm(\n","            range(self.tot_epochs), \n","            unit = \"epoch\",\n","            desc = \"SOURCE-ONLY TRAINING\")\n","        for e in epoch_iter:\n","            general_loss, acc_source = self.train_epoch(source_dataloader)\n","            logs = {\n","                \"general_loss\": general_loss, \n","                \"accuracy\": acc_source \n","                }\n","            epoch_iter.set_postfix(logs)\n","            if (general_loss > prev_general_loss or \n","                acc_source < prev_acc_source):\n","                patience = patience -
